The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a field that doesn't exist in your Firestore document.  This can happen if you're not properly handling potential null values. For example, if you have a document with a structure like this:

```json
{
  "name": "Example",
  "optionalField": null
}
```

And you try to access `document.optionalField.someNestedField`, you'll get an error because `optionalField` is null.
